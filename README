Project Structure
HTML - Basic structure of the application interface.
CSS - Styles for a simple and functional presentation.
JavaScript - Logic to search for exchange rates and calculate the conversion.

Code Description
HTML: Defines the user interface with fields for value input, currency selection, and a conversion button. Currency options are loaded dynamically using JavaScript.
CSS: Applies simple styling, making the interface clean and easy to use.
JavaScript:
Loads the list of available currencies at page start.
Adds an event to the form to convert the entered value when the button is clicked.
Fetches updated exchange rates from an external API (in this case, the ExchangeRate API) to perform the conversion.
Displays the conversion result or error messages in case of failure.
Notes
API Key: To use the application, you need a valid API key from an exchange rate service, such as the ExchangeRate API or Open Exchange Rates.
Security: For development purposes and simplicity, the API key is placed directly in the script. For production, it is recommended to protect this key using environment variables or other secure practices.
